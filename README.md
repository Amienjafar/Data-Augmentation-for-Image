# Data-Augmentation-for-Image

The process of transforming the original image into a new sample is known as data augmentation. For machine learning tasks, this technique is very helpful. Problems with a shortage of necessary datasets are typically addressed via data augmentation; these speeds up issue solving and improves the efficacy of the utilized classifications.

The settings utilized are the closest fill mode, rotation range of 30, rescale, zoom range of 0.2, horizontal flip, shear range of 0.1, and vertical flip.
